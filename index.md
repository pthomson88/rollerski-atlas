## Scotland - Central

|---|---|
| [![](/img/Bathgate-Caldercruix-map.png#previewmap)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1JsZ0qoeoCehcQnX9fXjmDTCpxYl9QLdc&ll=55.88459382711969%2C-3.7607757949379628&z=11) |  **Airdrie-Bathgate cycle path** <br/><br/> A traffic free cycle path right through the middle of the central belt. <br/><br/> The path itself connects Armadale rail station with Caldercruix rail station, but it's easy enough to start from Bathgate to add a few extra kilometers. In total the route is about 20km. After Caldercruix, getting to Airdrie itself is probably feasible for the more adventurous rollerskier, but it's certainly not for the faint-hearted|

| [![](/img/Alloa-Dollar-map.png#previewmap)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1JsZ0qoeoCehcQnX9fXjmDTCpxYl9QLdc&ll=56.128985207139884%2C-3.7566912805302044&z=12) |  **Alloa to Dollar** <br/><br/> AKA Clackmannan Endurance!.<br/><br/> The section from Alloa to Menstrie is particularly nice here, as well as the upper road from Menstrie to Dollar.<br/><br/> If you're looking for a good start point try "The Pavillions" in Alloa. Also if you plan to try the section between Tillicoutry and Alloa beware as it's not that great for rollerskiing.|

| [![](/img/North-Inch-map.png#previewmap)](https://www.strava.com/routes/2846780550560433606) |  **The North Inch (Perth)** <br/><br/> Starting from the Bertha High School car park, this 15km loop takes in some lovely Perthshire scenery along the rivers Almond and Tay.<br/><br/>Mostly flat, with the exception of a long hill at the start/finish. Mostly the tarmac is great, but some sections are a bit rough underfoot. The furthest section consists of a 2.4 km loop, so it's easy to add a few laps here if you're looking for a bit more distance. Alternatively this section is near the centre of Perth, so makes a great coffee stop option.

## Scotland - Edinburgh

|---|---|
| [![](/img/Sheriffhall-Roslyn-map.png#previewmap)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1JsZ0qoeoCehcQnX9fXjmDTCpxYl9QLdc&ll=55.90462751573069%2C-3.104388772723885&z=14) |  **Sheriffhall Park & ride to Roslyn Chapel** <br/><br/> Great surface, zero traffic and almost 9km of undisturbed rollerskiing each way.<br/><br/> The final section into Roslin itself is more sketchy underfoot with a mix of gravel patches, potholes and speed bumps to contend with finishing with a short stretch along a residential road. However it's worth it to make it to the Chapel.|

| [![](/img/Newhaven-Inverleith-map.png#previewmap)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1JsZ0qoeoCehcQnX9fXjmDTCpxYl9QLdc&ll=55.97360532652161%2C-3.2108047317310384&z=14) | **Newhaven and Inverleith Park loop** <br/><br/>Starting and finishing at 5 Points on the Inner Tube, this loop works well in either direction.<br/><br/> Incorporates a long and flat section of good tarmac at Newhaven as well as a good hill suitable for ascending and descending on the quiet residential Craighleith hill avenue. From the bottom of the hill this loop passes through Inverleith park before rejoining the Inner Tube on the way back to 5 Points. |

| [![](/img/Cramond-Inverleith-map.png#previewmap)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1JsZ0qoeoCehcQnX9fXjmDTCpxYl9QLdc&ll=55.97360532652161%2C-3.2108047317310384&z=14) | **Cramond - Granton - Inverleith loop** <br/><br/>Starting and finishing at Cramond Causeway, this ~20km loop includes a lot of coastline before cutting into the inner tube cycle network and winding it's way back to Cramond via Inverleith park and Silverknowes.<br/><br/>The first 10km is pretty flat with good tarmac and takes you to a convenient coffee stop at Milk cafe. From here it cuts through some residential streets and Inverleith park to the bottom of Craigleith hill Ave which is long but not too steep. Beware the busy road to get from the top of the hill back to the cycle paths. From here there is one downhill at Silverknowes that might feel quick but has plenty of run-out at the bottom. |

## Scotland - Fife 

| | |
|---|---|
| [![](/img/Dunfermline-Halbeath-map.png#previewmap)](https://www.strava.com/routes/2861343369178963188) |  **Dunfermline loop from Halbeath Park & ride** <br/><br/> AKA FRSC rollerski tour route #1. A 9.5 km almost loop using the Halbeath P&R as a convenient meeting point (and a good practice area). <br/><br/> From the park & ride to Crossgates is not really passable, so the best start point is where the new cycle path begins on the other side of Crossgates. From here you have a gentle downhill with the majority of it good surface. However beware of sections that haven't had the final layer added. Eventually you'll get to a junction which takes you over the motorway into Dunfermline and onto the cycle paths around Dulloch. Keep going past Fife leisure park to get back the Halbeath. |
