| | Sheriffhall Park & ride to Roslyn Chapel |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [![](/img/Sheriffhall-Roslyn-map.png#previewmap)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1JsZ0qoeoCehcQnX9fXjmDTCpxYl9QLdc&ll=55.90462751573069%2C-3.104388772723885&z=14) |  ### Sheriffhall Park & ride to Roslyn Chapel <br/><br/>Great surface, zero traffic and almost 9km of undisturbed rollerskiing each way.<br/><br/> The final section into Roslin itself is more sketchy underfoot with a mix of gravel patches, potholes and speed bumps to contend with finishing with a short stretch along a residential road. However it's worth it to make it to the Chapel.|

| | Newhaven and Inverleith Park loop |

| [![](/img/Newhaven-Inverleith-map.png#previewmap)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1JsZ0qoeoCehcQnX9fXjmDTCpxYl9QLdc&ll=55.97142126343152%2C-3.235630093367272&z=14) | Starting and finishing at 5 Points on the Inner Tube, this loop works well in either direction.<br/><br/> Incorporates a long and flat section of good tarmac at Newhaven as well as a good hill suitable for ascending and descending on the quiet residential Craighleith hill avenue. From the bottom of the hill this loop passes through Inverleith park before rejoining the Inner Tube on the way back to 5 Points |
