In total the route is about 20km. After Caldercruix, getting to Airdrie itself is probably feasible for the more adventurous rollerskier, but it's certainly not for the faint-hearted|

| [![](/img/Sheriffhall-Roslyn-map.png#previewmap)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1JsZ0qoeoCehcQnX9fXjmDTCpxYl9QLdc&ll=55.90462751573069%2C-3.104388772723885&z=14) |  **Sheriffhall Park & ride to Roslyn Chapel** <br/><br/> Great surface, zero traffic and almost 9km of undisturbed rollerskiing each way.<br/><br/> The final section into Roslin itself is more sketchy underfoot with a mix of gravel patches, potholes and speed bumps to contend with finishing with a short stretch along a residential road. However it's worth it to make it to the Chapel.|

| [![](/img/Newhaven-Inverleith-map.png#previewmap)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1JsZ0qoeoCehcQnX9fXjmDTCpxYl9QLdc&ll=55.97360532652161%2C-3.2108047317310384&z=14) | **Newhaven and Inverleith Park loop** <br/><br/>Starting and finishing at 5 Points on the Inner Tube, this loop works well in either direction.<br/><br/> Incorporates a long and flat section of good tarmac at Newhaven as well as a good hill suitable for ascending and descending on the quiet residential Craighleith hill avenue. From the bottom of the hill this loop passes through Inverleith park before rejoining the Inner Tube on the way back to 5 Points. |

## Fife

|---|---|
| [![](/img/Dunfermline-Halbeath-map.png#previewmap)](https://www.strava.com/routes/2836001716052111608) |  **Dunfermline loop from Halbeath Park & ride** <br/><br/> AKA FRSC rollerski tour route #1. A 9.5 km almost loop using the Halbeath P&R as a convenient meeting point (and a good practice area). <br/><br/> The connection between the Park and ride and Crossgates is not really passable, so the best start point is where the new cycle path begins on the other side of Crossgates. From here you have a gentle downhill towards Dalgety bay with the majority of it good surface. However beware of sections that haven't had the final layer adde. Eventually you'll get to a junction which takes you over the motorway into Dunfermline keep going until you reach the 3rd roundabout then go right and continue on the cycle paths to Fife leisure park. Go left here and keep on the cycle route to get back to the park & ride . |
